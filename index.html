<p>My name is Matteo Francia.</p>

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Bologna, Italy, where I am currently an adjunct professor and a post-doc research fellow. 
I am a member of the Business Intelligence Group and teach "Big Data" and "Principles of Informatics".
I was a visiting scholar at The University of Queensland in 2019. I received the MSc and BSc with honors from the University of Bologna in 2017 and 2014, respectively. 
My research mainly focuses on advanced analytics and unconventional data, with particular reference to trajectory, social, and sensory data.
